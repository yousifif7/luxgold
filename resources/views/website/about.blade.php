        <p class="about-askroro-story-paragraph">
          For over a decade, our founder experienced the same struggle countless parents face: how to find safe, 
          trusted, and quality family services. From daycare and preschools to afterschool programs, wellness 
          activities, and events, the process often felt fragmented, confusing, and overwhelming.
        </p>
        <p class="about-askroro-story-paragraph">
          Even years later, close friends and fellow parents shared the same frustration. Despite the rise of online 
          platforms, none provided a complete, one-stop hub that combined all the essentials families need with the 
          transparency and trust parents deserve.
        </p>
        <p class="about-askroro-story-paragraph">
          Some platforms focused only on babysitters. Others offered limited paid or free listings. But none solved the 
          bigger challenge: giving parents the ability to find, compare, and choose services confidently while also giving 
          providers a space to thrive.
        </p>
        <p class="about-askroro-story-paragraph">
          That realization led to the creation of AskRoro, a platform designed to be more than just a directory. AskRoro is 
          a community hub:
        </p>
        <ul class="about-askroro-story-bullet-list">
          <li class="about-askroro-story-bullet-item"><i style="color:#00bfa6" class="ms-1 bi bi-check2-circle"></i>A trusted place for parents to discover care, education, activities, and wellness.</li>
          <li class="about-askroro-story-bullet-item"><i style="color:#00bfa6" class="ms-1 bi bi-check2-circle"></i>A platform that helps families make confident, informed choices.</li>
          <li class="about-askroro-story-bullet-item"><i style="color:#00bfa6" class="ms-1 bi bi-check2-circle"></i>A space that empowers providers, from small family-owned businesses to schools and wellness experts, to connect with the families who need them.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="about-askroro-story-paragraph">
          AskRoro was built on the belief that parents deserve clarity instead of confusion, choice instead of compromise, 
          and confidence instead of stress.
