    <p>Welcome to luxGold. Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our website(s), products, services, and applications (the “Services”).</p>
    <p>These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and Privy Consulting, Inc., doing business as luxGold (“luxGold,” “Company,” “we,” or “us”).</p>
    <p>You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you don’t have the right to use the Services. Your use of the Services in any way means that you agree to these Terms, which will remain in effect while you use the Services.</p>
    <p>These Terms include this document, as well as our Privacy Policy and any community guidelines we may publish.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about these Terms or the Services, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:info@luxgold.com">info@luxgold.com</a></p>

    <h4>Will these Terms ever change?</h4>
    <p>We are constantly improving luxGold, so these Terms may need to change as well. If we make material changes, we’ll notify you through the website, by email, or other reasonable methods.</p>
    <p>If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to discontinue using the Services. Continued use of luxGold after updated Terms go into effect means you agree to them.</p>

    <h4>Privacy</h4>
    <p>luxGold values the privacy of customers and cleaners. Please review our Privacy Policy for details.</p>
    <p>We comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Parents/guardians provide, and control information shared about their children. If we discover information was submitted without parental consent, we will delete it promptly.</p>

    <h4>Using AskRoro</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Not to impersonate another person.</li>
      <li>To keep login credentials secure.</li>
      <li>To use luxGold only for lawful purposes, consistent with our mission to connect customers with trusted cleaners.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You must be of legal age to form a binding contract or have parental/guardian consent to use the Services.</p>

    <p>Violation of these rules may result in suspension or termination of your account.</p>

    <h4>Provider Listings & Reviews</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Providers are responsible for the accuracy of their listings, pricing, and information.</li>
      <li>Reviews must be honest and respectful. We may remove reviews that violate our guidelines.</li>
      <li>Some provider profiles may include Sponsored or Featured labels; these indicate paid placement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Intellectual Property</h4>
    <p>All content on luxGold (logos, text, graphics, design, software) is owned by luxGold or its licensors. You may not use, copy, or distribute content without permission, except for personal, non-commercial use.</p>
    <p>Anything you post (reviews, comments, uploads) remains yours, but you grant luxGold a license to use it for operating the Services.</p>

    <h4>Payments & Premium Services</h4>
    <p>Some Services (e.g., provider memberships, featured listings) may require payment. By subscribing, you agree to:</p>

    <h4>Termination</h4>
    <p>You may stop using luxGold at any time. We may suspend or terminate your account if you violate these Terms. Certain obligations (fees, intellectual property rights, indemnities, etc.) will survive termination.</p>

    <h4>Disclaimers & Limitations of Liability</h4>
    <p>luxGold strives to connect customers with quality cleaners but does not guarantee outcomes. All cleaners are independent businesses, and luxGold is not responsible for their services.</p>
    <p><strong>THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS.” TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LUXGOLD DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.</strong></p>
    <p>In no event will AskRoro be liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.</p>

    <h4>Indemnity</h4>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold AskRoro harmless against claims, damages, or expenses resulting from your use of the Services or violation of these Terms.</p>

    <h4>Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h4>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Texas, USA. Any disputes will be resolved through binding arbitration in Dallas County, Texas, unless otherwise required by law.</p>

    <h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, are the entire agreement between you and AskRoro.</li>
      <li>If any provision is found unenforceable, the rest still applies.</li>
      <li>You may not transfer your rights under these Terms without AskRoro’s consent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>luxGold exists to help customers find safe, trusted, and professional cleaning services. By using luxGold, you agree to treat others with respect, provide accurate information, and use the platform lawfully.</p>
